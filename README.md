The main objective of the project is to let users give their own cars on rent as well as rent other cars directly without any third party interference or any company so that users can directly get into contact with car owners instead of having to pay commissions to any middleman or company. We have provided users to select cars as per their requirement and the system will give charge according to it. Our application has user friendly interface. Also, we have used Blockchain for the transactions which would be having decentralized structure will help in security and privacy.
